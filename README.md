Extinguish
Functionality & MVPs
Fill in this template:

Extinguish is a game that is based on the hand held electronic game Lightsout. The game will work as follows:

* The base game will begin on a 5 * 5 grid.
* Each posiion on the grid will store a value: "on/off" 
* The user can choose to have the board generate a starting state or the user can select which positions to toggle on before starting the game.
* Once the user selects to start a game, the goal is to have all positions on the board to be set to off. 
* A positions state is toggled when the user selects that position. 
* When a positions state is toggled it also impacts the state of all of the adjacent postions, toggling their values.



This project includes:
* Webpack 
* Babel 
* NPM 

Future updates will include:
* Seemless level resets 
* More levels 
* Random levels 
* Solution hints 
* Ability to create custom levels
* Store scores
* Tile animations

Potential bonus functionality:
* Secret bonus level
* Preset start states that the user can select from visually
* Allowing the user to select a larger game grid
* Adding additional states to each position.


Currently grid generation is handled by passing in an array of 5 numbers from 0 - 31 inclusive. This range represents all possible arrangements for 2 values to be stored an object of length 5. 
Each number is then converted to a string representing its binary value and then padded with leading zeros to ensure that it is 5 digits long.
Then split and each 0 or 1 converted from a string back to an integer and any 1 will then represent a lit square.  
By doing it this way we can store boards without the need to hardcode their x, y coordinates for each space, and future boards can be generated by picking a number in range (0, 31) for each row.  This will also allow for future implementations with different grid sizes as the number of possible combination is based on 2 to the nth power where n represents the length of the rows.


```javascript   
 numsToGrid(arr) {
    const grid = []
    arr.forEach(num => {
        let stringRow = ('0000' + num.toString(2)).split('').slice(-5)
        let row = []
        stringRow.forEach(num =>{
            row.push(Math.floor(num))
        } )
        grid.push(row)
    })
    return grid
}

```

As an example the level below can be stored in an array of length 5 consisting of [31, 0, 31, 0, 31]
