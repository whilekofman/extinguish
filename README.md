Functionality & MVPs
Fill in this template:

Extinguish is a game that is based on the hand held electronic game Lightsout. The game will work as follows:

* The base game will begin on a 5 * 5 grid.
* Each posiion on the grid will store a value: "on/off" 
* The user can choose to have the board generate a starting state or the user can select which positions to toggle on before starting the game.
* Once the user selects to start a game, the goal is to have all positions on the board to be set to off. 
* A positions state is toggled when the user selects that position. 
* When a positions state is toggled it also impacts the state of all of the adjacent postions, toggling their values.



In addition, this project will include:
* Canvas API implementation 
* Webpack 
* Babel 
* NPM 

Potential bonus functionality:
* Secret bonus level
* Preset start states that the user can select from visually
* Allowing the user to select a larger game grid
* Adding additional states to each position.

* On load the user will be presented with the rules of the game, and have the ability to select how to start
* Personel links, github, linkedIn, etc and About
