                    <p>Welcome to Extinguish! The goal of Extinguish is to put out all of the fires! This game is inspired by the game Lights
                        Out produced by Tiger Electronics in the 90s.<br>
                        <br>The game consists of a 5 * 5 grid. At the begining of the game some of the tiles on the grid will be lit and
                        others
                        will
                        be a peacful forest. It is your goal to put out all of the fires. To do this you can click on a lit tile
                        directly and it
                        will put out the fire. If any of the tiles neighbors are lit this will have the added bonus of putting them out
                        as well!
                        Before clicking be careful, because as you put out the fire in one tile a fire will start in all of its
                        neighboring
                        tiles if one isn't already burning. Like wise you can start a fire in a forest tile that will put out a fire in
                        neighboring tiles or light them if there is no fire burning in them. In the image here you would win the game by
                        pressing the tile on the bottom right hand corner. There is no undo button.  If you need to undo, you can just click the same tile again!
                    </p>
